SQL based lab management system demonstrating database design, multi-table joins, constraints, and analytical queries.
Microbial Lab Management System (SQL)

# Overview
A relational database project designed to manage structured data in a microbial research laboratory. The system stores information about researchers, samples, instruments, reagents, experiments, and results.The goal was to apply database design principles and use SQL to efficiently organize and analyze laboratory data.

# Database Structure
The system includes six interconnected tables:
- Researchers
- Samples
- Instruments
- Reagents
- Experiments
- Results
Primary and Foreign Keys were used to maintain referential integrity. The database was normalized to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency.

# SQL Concepts Applied
- CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE  
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
- WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN  
- INNER JOIN  
- GROUP BY, HAVING  
- COUNT(), MAX()  
- Subqueries & Constraint
  
# How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench  
2. Import the .sql file
